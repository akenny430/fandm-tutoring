# Tutoring at Franklin & Marshall College

While at Franklin & Marshall College, I was a mathematics tutor with the [Quantitative & Science Center (Q&SC)](https://www.fandm.edu/academics/quantitative-science-center)
for three years. I was able to tutor several courses, mainly Calculus I, II, and III, Probability & Statistics I and II, and Linear Algebra & Differential 
Equations. As a tutor I mainly hosted drop-in sessions and individual sessions, but during my last semester we were allowed to monitor classes as well. 

There were various times throughout my three years as a tutor where a tutee came in with a question but I was unable to fully answer their question before they 
left the session. In these cases, I would prepare them a supplementary LaTeX document, where I would summarize and clarify anything covered and missed during 
our meeting. All of the documents are split up among different file, where each file designated the class that the tutee came from, and are named as the date
which the tutee came to a session.

The quality of these documents vary greaty; while most are meant to be a very quick reference for the tutee, several instances allowed me to explain a 
fundamental concept well or make an intuitive visualization, and I dedicated more time to these cases. I put a "+" in front of my personal favorites. 
Unfortunately, the corresponding tex files have been lost.
